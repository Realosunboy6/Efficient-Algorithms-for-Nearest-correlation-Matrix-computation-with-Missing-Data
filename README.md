The code in your `THESISCODE.ipynb` notebook is a Julia script for loading, processing, and analyzing stock market data, likely as a preparatory step for further financial modeling or algorithmic research (such as computing nearest correlation matrices with missing data). Here’s a summary of what each section does:

### 1. **Package Imports**
- Loads various Julia packages for data handling (`CSV`, `DataFrames`), time series analysis (`TSFrames`), numerical/statistical operations (`Statistics`, `NaNStatistics`, `LinearAlgebra`, `LinearAlgebra.LAPACK`), portfolio analytics, and timing code execution.

### 2. **Loading Stock Data**
- Defines a function `load_stocks` that:
  - Takes a directory and a list of CSV filenames.
  - Reads each CSV, extracts relevant columns (`Date`, `Ticker`, `Close`, `Sector`), and combines all data into a single DataFrame.
  - Handles missing files gracefully.
- Loads stock data from several sector-specific CSV files into a combined DataFrame with columns: `Date`, `Ticker`, `Close`, `Sector`.

### 3. **Data Exploration and Validation**
- Counts and prints:
  - The number of rows (data points) per sector.
  - The number of unique tickers (stocks) per sector.
  - The total number of unique stocks.
  - Lists all unique stock tickers.

### 4. **Preprocessing**
- Filters the combined DataFrame to include only `Date`, `Ticker`, and `Close`.
- Converts the `Date` column to the proper `DateTime` format.
- Filters the dataset to a specific date range (2020-01-02 to 2025-09-08).
- Sorts the filtered DataFrame by date and ticker.

### 5. **Time Series Transformation**
- Reshapes the data into a "wide" time series format (likely using TSFrames), where:
  - Each column is a unique stock ticker.
  - Each row is a date.
  - Each cell contains the closing price for that stock on that date.

### **Purpose and Context**
- **Goal:** Prepare structured, cleaned, and time-aligned stock price data for all S&P 500 stocks (or a large subset) across multiple sectors for further quantitative or algorithmic analysis.
- **Next Steps (implied):** This setup is typically used as input for algorithms that require a rectangular (date × ticker) data matrix, such as correlation matrix computation, factor modeling, or portfolio optimization—especially in the presence of missing data.

#### **In short:**  
This code loads and cleans multi-sector stock price data, aggregates it into a wide time series format indexed by date and ticker, and performs basic exploratory data analysis—likely as a first step in a larger thesis or research project focused on financial algorithms.
